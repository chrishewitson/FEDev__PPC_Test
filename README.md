# FEDev__PPC_Test

The task

Take this version of a page from our Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC) service - use your own judgement to decide what is missing, broken and could be improved in both the html and css. You aren't expected to complete all fixes to the page in the alloted time, but you'll be expected to identify what is missing and have set about making improvements. Submissions should have attempts to fix code along with suggested fixes, changes and improvments.
